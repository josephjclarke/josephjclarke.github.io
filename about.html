<h1>About </h1>
<p>I’m working towards a PhD in Climate Science at the University of Exeter, supervised by <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/pmc205">Peter Cox</a>, <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/pashwin">Peter Ashwin</a> and somewhat unofficially by <a href="https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/pdlr201">Paul Ritchie</a>.</p>

<p>My research falls into the field of climate dynamics. More specifically I’m interested in emergent constraints, tipping points and the links between the two. I use a hierarchy of models, from the
qualitative (in a mathematical sense) insights of dynamical systems theory to complex global numerical models like

<p>I completed a master’s degree in physics from the University of Oxford, focusing on condensed matter
and the physics of atmospheres and oceans. My master’s project was titled ‘Heat Engine Based Representation of
Convection with Phase Change in Exoplanet Atmospheres’ and was supervised by  <a href="https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~pierrehumbert/">Raymond Pierrehumbert</a>.</p>

<p>I have also worked with <a href="http://hannahchristensen.co.uk/">Hannah Christensen</a> on ‘A Dynamical Systems
Approach to Constraining Climate Sensitivity’.</p>
