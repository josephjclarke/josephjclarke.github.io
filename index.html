      I'm a climate scientist working at the <a href="https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/staff/jc1147">University of Exeter</a>.
      My research is principly concerned with tipping points in the climate system; I am interested both in the processes that
      lead to them and also how we can get early warning signals for tipping points in a system agnostic way.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My research grapples with the fundamentally non-autonomous nature of tipping in rapidly forced systems like the climate. This leads to interesting
      phenomena like rate dependence and overshoot behaviour.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have a particular interest in tipping within the terrestrial carbon cycle, which is probably related to the fact that I am supervised by
      <a href="https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/staff/pmc205">Peter Cox</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      More broadly I am interested in how approaches from statistical physics (the
      theory that describes the macroscopic behaviour emerging from systems comprised of many degrees of freedom) can be useful in climate science (the theory the describes the macroscopic
      behaviour emerging from the components of the Earth System).
