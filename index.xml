      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m worried that there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough websites.&#xA;ðŸ–± A similar process is at work in how we access music and movies. In the not so distant past I would listen to music from a mountain of mp3 files on my hard drive, whereas now I stream it. In return for convenience, we don&amp;rsquo;t own media anymore: we rent it. Most people&amp;rsquo;s internet usage (including mine) is concentrated on a few websites, owned by private interests who are often bad stewards of the website they run.</description>

      <description>ðŸ–± A photo of me standing on Snowdon. I&amp;rsquo;m a climate scientist working at the University of Exeter. My research is principally concerned with tipping points in the climate system; I am interested both in the processes that lead to them and also how we can get early warning signals for tipping points in a system agnostic way.&#xA;My research grapples with the fundamentally non-autonomous nature of tipping in rapidly forced systems like the climate.</description>
