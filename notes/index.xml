      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m worried that there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough websites.&#xA;ðŸ–± A similar process is at work in how we access music and movies. In the not so distant past I would listen to music from a mountain of mp3 files on my hard drive, whereas now I stream it. In return for convenience, we don&amp;rsquo;t own media anymore: we rent it. Most people&amp;rsquo;s internet usage (including mine) is concentrated on a few websites, owned by private interests who are often bad stewards of the website they run.</description>
